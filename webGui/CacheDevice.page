> The Cache disk is a device *outside* the unRAID array.  It may be exported for network access just
> like the Array disks.  Being outside the unRAID array results in significantly faster write access
> at the cost of no data protection - if the Cache device fails all data contained on it may be lost.
> 
> When [User Shares](/Settings/ShareSettingsMenu) are enabled, user shares may be configured to
> automatically make use of the Cache disk in order to
> speed up writes.  A special background process called the *mover* can be scheduled to run
> periodically to move user share files off the Cache disk and onto the Array.
