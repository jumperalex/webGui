> **Temp.** (temperature) is read directly from the drive.  You configure which units to use on
> the [Display Preferences](Settings/Display) page.  We don't read the temperature of spun-down hard
> drives since this typically causes them to spin up; instead we display an `*` symbol instead.  We also
> display an `*` symbol for SSD and Flash devices.

> **Size, Used, Free** reports the total disk size, used space, and remaining space for files.  These
> units are also configured on the [Display Preferences](Settings/Display) page.  The
> amount of space used will be non-zero even for an empty disk due to file system overhead.

> **Reads, Writes** are a count of I/O requests sent to the disk I/O drivers.  These statistics may
> be cleared at any time, refer to the Array Status section below.

> **Errors** counts the number of *unrecoverable* errors reported by the disk
> I/O drivers. Missing data due to unrecoverable read errors is filled in on-the-fly using parity
> reconstruct (and we attempt to write this data back to the sector(s) which failed). Any unrecoverable
> write error results in *disabling* the disk.

> **View** column contains a folder icon indicating the device is *mounted*. Click the icon to

> #### Assigning Devices
>
> An unRAID disk array consists of a single parity disk and a number of data disks. The data
> disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the parity disk provides the redundancy necessary
> to recover from any singe disk failure.
> 
> Note that we're careful to use the term *disk* when referring to an array storage device.  We
> use the term *hard drive* (or sometimes just *drive*) when referring to an actual hard disk drive (HDD)
> device. This is because in a RAID system it's possible to read/write an array disk whose corresponding
> hard drive is disabled or even missing! In addition, it's useful to be able to ask, "which device is
> assigned to be the parity disk?"; or, "which device corresponds to disk2?".
> 
> We therefore need a way to assign hard drives to array disks. This is accomplished here on the
> Main page when the array is stopped. There is a drop-down box for each array disk which lists all the
> unassigned devices. To assign a device simply select it from the list. Each time a device
> assignment is made, the system updates a configuration file to record the assignment.
> 
> #### Requirements
> 
> Unlike traditional RAID systems which stripe data across all the array devices, an unRAID server
> stores files on individual hard drives. Consequently, all file write operations will involve both the
> data disk the file is being written to, and the parity disk. For these reasons,
> 
> * the parity disk size must be as large or larger than any of the data disks,
> 
> and
> 
> * given a choice, the parity disk should be the fastest disk in your collection.
> 
> #### Guidelines
> 
> Here are the steps you should follow when designing your unRAID disk array:
> 
> 1. Decide which hard drive you will use for parity, and which hard drives you will use for
> data disk1, disk2, etc., and label them in some fashion. Also, find the serial number of each hard
> drive and jot it down somewhere; you will need this information later.
> 
> 2. Install your hard drive devices, boot unRAID Server and bring up the webGui. If this is a fresh system
> build, then the Main page will show no disks installed. This doesn't mean the system can't detect your
> hard drives; it just means that none have been assigned yet.
> 
> 3. Remember the serial numbers you recored back in step 1? For parity and each data disk, select the
> proper hard drive based on it's serial number from the drop down list.
>
> #### Hot Plug
>
> You may also *hot plug* hard drives into your server if your hardware supports it. For example,
> if you are using hard drive cages, you may simply plug them into your server while powered on and
> with array Stopped. Refresh the Main page to have new unassigned devices appear in the assignment
> dropdown lists.
> 
> #### Next Steps
>
> Once you have assigned all of your hard drives, refer to the Array Status section below
> and Start the array.
